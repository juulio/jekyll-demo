      <h2>I'm a Black Belt Karate Teacher</h2>

      <p>
        I've been practicing Kyokushin Karate since 1995. I've known hundreds of
        people while practicing, learning, competing, teaching and sharing a
        good time through karate activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004 I was lucky enough to fully dedicate myself to the practice of
        karate. I was part of an uchi deshi program (internship student) at New
        York City for 1 month and then at Ikebukuro, Tokyo for 4 months.
        Needless to say, these experiences had a positive impact on my entire
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I participated in 4 Kyokushin World Tournaments in Japan, in the years
        2003, 2007, 2009 and 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2018 I hold a 3rd degree (san dan) black belt and I'm a teacher in
        Costa Rica.{' '}
